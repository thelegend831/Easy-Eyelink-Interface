function [] = EyelinkNotify(message, eyelinkconnected)
% EYELINKNOTIFY(message, eyelinkconnected) displays a message on Eyelink Host PC
% Message can be any string you like to be displayed in the bottom right
% corner of the host pc. This is can be useful, when you want to run in
% single screen mode and keep track of trials. Keep in mind, that the space
% for characters is limited. Usually you'd want something like this:
%  EyelinkNotify(sprintf('Trial %i/%i', itrial, maxnumbertrials))
%
% 'eyelinkconnected' can be useful when your experiment has a single
% parameter that controls whether eyetracking should be used or not (e.g.,
% 'P.isET'). If 1 (default), the function sends a message, if 0, the
% function simply does nothing.
