function [] = EyelinkTrigger(message, eyelinkconnected)
% EYELINKTRIGGER(message, eyelinkconnected) sends a trigger to the Eyelink.
% message must be a string
%
% 'eyelinkconnected' can be useful when your experiment has a single
% parameter that controls whether eyetracking should be used or not (e.g.,
% 'P.isET'). If 1 (default), the function sends a trigger, if 0, the
% function simply does nothing.
