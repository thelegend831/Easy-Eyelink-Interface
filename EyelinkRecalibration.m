function EyelinkRecalibration(P, eyelinkconnected)
% EYELINKRECALIBRATION(P, eyelinkconnected)
% performs recalibration of a connected Eyetracker after breaks etc
%
% Needs P.el with all subfields introduced during the initial calibration
% called by startEyelink including P.el.capture(1:4), indicating which
% datatyes to record.
%
% 'eyelinkconnected' should be 0 or 1 (default). If 0, the function does
% nothing.
