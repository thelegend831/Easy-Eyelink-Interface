% [didrecal, FixationOnset] = EyelinkControlFixation(P, Tmin, Tmax, loc,
%                             maxDegDeviation, eyelinkconnected, pixperdeg)
%
% INPUT:
%   P                 = Struct with field P.el created during EyelinkStart
%   P.trackr.dummymode= Optional 1 or 0 (default). If 1, Mouse location is
%                       taken as gaze coordinates. To make code work, this
%                       function always sets the mouse to the proper
%                       location.
%   Tmin              = mininum time a subject should look at loc
%   Tmax              = maximum time after which, in case of no fixation at
%                       target, a recalibration is started and
%                       'didrecal' = 1 returned.
%   loc               = [x, y] target location in px coordinates
%   maxDegDeviation   = how many degree is the subject allowed to deviate
%                       from the target?
%   eyelinkconnected  = if it's not connected (0), function does nothing
%                       and simply returns current time.
%   pixperdeg         = how many pixels form one degree?
%   dorecal           = if 1 (default), see Tmax. If 0, didrecal is
%                       still 1, but no recalibration ist started.
%   IgnoreBlinks      = Default is 0. If 1, will keep counting until
%                       Tmin, as if subject would keep fixating, even when
%                       subject blinks.
%
%
% OUTPUT:
%   didrecal          = Is 1, in case the subject did not fixate for Tmax
%                       and we recalibrated.
%   FixationOnset     = Time, when the subject started fixating at target.
%                       If no fixation reached --> Inf
%   hsmvd             = "hasmoved" did the subject move the eyes after the
%                       initial fixation?
